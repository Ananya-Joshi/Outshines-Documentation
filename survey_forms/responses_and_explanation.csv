While it is not a rapid change, it seems to be a sustained change which is concerning.",This point appears to be indicating a large rapid surge in doctor visits which is similar to previous surges in the data stream. The data warrants further investigation as it may be an indicator of a surge in infection rates. ,"This point appears to be either in the middle of a large surge, or at a potential peak. This makes the point particularly interesting as the subject of further investigation as the information indicated here can either lead to further preventative measures, or an increase in ongoing measures to further reverse the trend shown leading up to the current point.","This appears to be a long-term sustained upward trend which doesn't make the selected point particularly interesting, but in general a point like this at the end of a sustained trend may still be interesting to investigate as it may reveal a larger pattern in the data.","This point is also in the middle of a smaller surge in doctor visits. Based on the scale of previous surges, it appears interesting to investigate as it may be a potential peak.",B,4,(1) A Little,(5) Most,(5) Most,(1) A Little,This surge in doctor visits is a little concerning expecially when considered on a scale of most recent trends (for the past ~3-4 months) as it shows a surge on the same scale as the rest of the upward trends in the rest of the data in this subset. It warrants some investigation as a result.,"This appears to be in the middle of a sustained upward trend. Whiel this point in particular may not be interesting or concerning in particular when considered in context, it definitely may reveal some information about this trend. ",This is a very concerning point as it is in the middle of a very large and rapid upward trend in the data which indicates that there is either an issue with reporting (note data sparsity in other portions of the graph) or there is a very concerning change taking place on a scale which hasn't occurred since the beginning of the data signal available to us.,"Also a very concerning point as it is in the middle of a large and rapid upward trend in data which is not seen recently in the data stream. It is more likely that this point is of actual concern since the signal is not sparse and while the data was trending on average downward previously, it is now surging back up.","This point in particular is not very concerning as it is in the middle of a sustained and steady trend upward. The trend itself if interesting, but this point does not deviate from a constant trend, making it less concerning than say a point at the beginning of this trend (ie. june 30 - july 5th 2023)"

The recent peak is even relevant and visible on the year-long time scale, so it's especially concerning.","Row 3 time series is concerning because its recent two data points contains a big change from its most recent values. However on the year-long scale, this change is not very large and on the shorter time scale, jumps of a similar size have been observed, so it's not too surprising.","Row 4 appears to be a very run of the mill linear trend, so no concern.","Row 5 is mildly concerning due to the latest few data points. The time series is not as noisy/jumpy as Row 3, so it carries more weight.
